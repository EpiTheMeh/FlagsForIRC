Hey, thanks for taking the time to look at my repository, and maybe even use
the scripts I, with help, modified.
Currently they are only a handful of the 'Queer Pride' flags, though I have plans to expand to things
such as the national colours of various countries - for flags, for racing colours, and for sporting
colours.

As of yet, I have only made these scripts for kvirc, though, with some modification, they
will work with most IRC clients that support perl scripting.
I plan to test the scripts with various clients as I learn my way around perl, and the vagaries of
different clients.

To install, using the menu in KVirc, click the word 'scripting' in the menu bar along the top
of the window, and then click on 'execute script'. Navigate to the files, and execute them.
To use the scripts, enter a forward slash (' / ') followed by the name of the file, a space, and
the text you wish to colour, so, for example,

	/Queer_gay Hello World

Which will return:

	hello world
	
(In colour, of course)
Have a good time with the script, and try not to get in trouble! I don't want you using this for
spam! :P

OH, and before I forget:
You're free to share, modify, contribute, whatever you like! This is just for fun, for me, and
I'm really not bothered! Just don't do anything offensive (IE. I don't want to see anyone uploading
scripts to this repository with offensive names.)
